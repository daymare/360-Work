Program simulating bash.

Starting out going to just reuse bash commands

Bash is an interpreter and does not care whether commands are entered to stdin or from a file.

We are building an interpreter.

Feature list:
    Must act like bash for the most part.
        IE must run an interpreter like bash
        Must implement wildcards/REGEX
    Must have something else that is ridiculous and experimental and fun.

Bash Feature list: (remember bash is a programming language)
    piping
    lists
    control structures
    functions
    variables

    Expansion
    Redirection
    Scripting
    Running commands
    Interactive History

Built in commands:
    cd
    eval
    exec
    exit
    pwd
    return
    echo

Bash Execution order:
    // read input line from a file (either the terminal or a file)
    // tokenize input
    // parse tokens into commands (simple or compound)
    // perform shell expansions
    // perform any redirections
    // executes THE command (only one command?)
    // optionally wait for the command to complete and collect exit status



Notes:
    Bash is recursive, commands are run in subshells that are linked to the main shell.
    I do not care about effeciency, I care about power. Effeciency comes later.
